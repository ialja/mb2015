We make small, stylish and connected Cubes that monitor your indoor environment, so we'll be able to see whether the environment at WebCamp is giving everyone a headache. Our Base station is based on Raspberry Pi Model B, and we also have an [API](https://my.cubesensors.com/docs) that can be used for interesting web projects.

P.S.: We’re also [looking for developers](https://cubesensors.com/join-us/)!
